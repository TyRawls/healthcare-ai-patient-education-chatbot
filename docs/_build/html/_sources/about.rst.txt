Optimizing a stock portfolio is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it aims to maximize returns while minimizing risk, aligning with an investor's financial 
goals and risk tolerance. By diversifying investments across various asset classes, industries, and geographic regions, portfolio optimization helps spread risk, 
reducing the impact of adverse market movements on overall returns. Additionally, optimization strategies may involve rebalancing portfolios periodically to 
maintain desired asset allocations, ensuring they remain aligned with changing market conditions and investment objectives. Ultimately, optimizing a stock 
portfolio enhances the potential for achieving long-term financial growth and stability, providing investors with greater confidence in their investment 
decisions and overall financial well-being. This project aims to do just that.
