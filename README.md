# AMYTHEST

[**AMYTHEST**](https://amythest.streamlit.app/) (AI Messaging Yielding Thoughtful Human-like Engagement Systems Technology) is an AI chatbot developed to deliver high-quality health education materials utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), thereby improving outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.

### âš¡ Key Features

* Accepts health-related input queries and provides a response based on the query
* Modify user chat bubble and icon color
* Choose between three different Language Learning Models (LLM):
    * OpenAI - ChatGPT 4o
    * META - LLaMA 3
    * Google - Gemma

### ðŸ§  How It Works

[**AMYTHEST**](https://amythest.streamlit.app/) uses RAG technology which is a method that enhances the generation of text by integrating relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base or dataset to provide more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

A user input query is converted into a vector embedding, which is then compared to the documents in the Pinecone database to retrieve the most relevant matches. The identified documents are subsequently provided to the LLM to generate a human-like response.
