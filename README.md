About
-----
Patient education is essential in healthcare, providing significant benefits for both patients and providers. It empowers 
patients with knowledge about their conditions, treatments, and preventive measures, fostering informed decision-making 
and active participation in healthcare. This leads to better treatment adherence, health outcomes, and reduced costs. 
Additionally, patient education promotes autonomy, self-care, and satisfaction, while providers benefit from fewer visits, 
improved communication, and stronger patient relationships, enhancing overall healthcare efficiency and care quality.
